## Welcome! üëã

Thanks for checking out this mini project
This is a simple web application showcasing my command of HTML, CSS and Javascript.

## The challenge

The main challenge here creating a solid game logic and implementing it through Javascript

## Gameplay üéÆ

Each turn, a player repeatedly rolls a die until either a 1 is rolled or the player decides to "hold".

- If the player rolls a 1, they score nothing and it becomes the next player's turn.
- If the player rolls any other number, it is added to their turn total and the player's turn continues.
- If a player chooses to "hold", their turn total is added to their score, and it becomes the next player's turn.
  The first player to score 100 or more points wins.

## Features

- Error handling
